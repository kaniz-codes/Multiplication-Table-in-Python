# Multiplication-Table-in-Python
This code is a simple Python program that takes an integer input from the user and then prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

- The code prompts the user to enter a number by displaying the message "Enter Number: ".
- The 𝒊𝒏𝒑𝒖𝒕() function is used to read a line of text (user input) from the console, and 𝒊𝒏𝒕() is used to convert that input into an integer. The entered integer is stored in the variable 𝒏𝒖𝒎.

- This code sets up a 𝒇𝒐𝒓 loop that iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
- In each iteration, the variable 𝒊 takes on a value from 1 to 10.

- Inside the loop, this line of code calculates the product of 𝒏𝒖𝒎 (the user-entered number) and 𝒊 (the current value in the range).
- It then prints the multiplication expression in the format: 𝒏𝒖𝒎 x 𝒊 = 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕, where 𝒏𝒖𝒎 and 𝒊 are the respective values, and 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕 is the calculated product.
- This line effectively prints the multiplication table for the entered number, ranging from 1 to 10.

4️⃣ 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭:

- After running the program, the user will see the multiplication table for the entered number. For example, if the user enters 5, the program will output:
